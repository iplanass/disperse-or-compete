This is the code and rasters used in: "Planas-Sitj√† I, Monnin T, Loeuille N, and Cronin L A, (2023). To disperse or compete? Coevolution of traits leads to a limited number of reproductive strategies. OIKOS" (accepted 25/04/2023)

Simulation was written in R, and was written to run in multiple cores for several conditions at a time. It has a section for parameters, and simulation below.
This code will create a folder for each condition, and save results of each simulation at specific intervals (see parameter section of the simulation code) and at the end.

File "Aggregated.zip" contains 20 rasters used as Aggregated Landscape. File "Random.zip" contains 20 rasters used as Random Landscape.
